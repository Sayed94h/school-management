## Todos before starting the app:

1. Enter Your Own MongoDB Connection String inside `appsettings.json`.
2. Install dependencies for Web Api(check NuGet package manager).
3. Remove `package-lock.json`  before doing the next step.
4. Install dependencies for React: Jump to the ClientApp directory and run `npm install` in your terminal.

### Info

I modified the file `package.json` but the original version of this file is `package copy.json` in case you want to install all dependencies came with React inside ASP .Net Core.
